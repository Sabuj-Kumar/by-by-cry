  # To add asset to your application, add an asset section, like this:
  assets:
    - asset/images/
    - asset/images/icon_png/
    - asset/images/sounds_image/
    - asset/images/icon_png/now_playing_icon/
    - assets/babyCry/


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding asset from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Neue Einstellung
      fonts:
        - asset: asset/fonts/NeueEinstellung-Normal.otf
        - asset: asset/fonts/Neue Einstellung Bold.ttf
        - asset: asset/fonts/f0174917-35f6-45fd-bd28-21254c0a6102.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
